# ✅ Railway 502 Error Fix Applied

## 🔧 Problem Identified
Railway deployment succeeded but returned 502 errors:
- Application failed to respond to HTTP requests
- Server logs showed "Server running" but no HTTP listener active

## 🔍 Root Cause
**package.json start script was incorrect:**
- Was: `"start": "tsx src/server.ts"`
- Problem: server.ts only exports Hono app, doesn't start HTTP server
- Solution: index.ts has the actual server startup code with `server.listen()`

## ✅ Fix Applied
**Commit:** `a41d90e`
**Change:** Updated start script to use correct file

```json
// package.json
"scripts": {
  "start": "tsx src/index.ts", // ✅ Now points to correct file
}
```

## 🚀 Railway Auto-Deploy Status

Railway will automatically redeploy from GitHub:
- ✅ Fix pushed to master branch
- 🔄 Railway should detect change within 1-2 minutes
- 🔄 New deployment will start automatically
- ⏱️ **Estimated time:** 3-5 minutes

## 📊 Expected Results

When deployment completes:
- ✅ Server will properly listen on PORT
- ✅ Health endpoint will respond
- ✅ All API endpoints accessible
- ✅ WebSocket connections work

## 🧪 Test Production URL

```bash
# Your Railway URL (from Railway dashboard)
curl https://web-production-d9b2.up.railway.app/health

# Expected response:
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "...",
  "providers": {}
}
```

## 📋 What index.ts Does

The correct startup file (index.ts) includes:
1. HTTP server creation with `createServer()`
2. WebSocket server setup for real-time capture
3. Proper request handling through Hono app
4. Server listening on PORT with `server.listen(port)`

## 💬 Status

**Current:** Waiting for Railway to redeploy with fix
**Next:** Test production endpoints once deployed
**URL:** https://web-production-d9b2.up.railway.app

## 🎯 Integration Code (Ready When Deployed)

```javascript
// Frontend integration example
const BRIDGE_URL = 'https://web-production-d9b2.up.railway.app';

// Test connection
fetch(`${BRIDGE_URL}/health`)
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data => console.log('Bridge Status:', data));

// External Data API
fetch(`${BRIDGE_URL}/external/data/sessions/create`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    title: 'My App Session',
    platform: 'custom-app',
    metadata: { version: '1.0' }
  })
});
```

**Fix complete - Railway is redeploying now** ✅
