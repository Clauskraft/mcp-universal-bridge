## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS

### What Expert Reviews Missed
The 20 expert reviews identified **180+ technical issues**, but missed critical **user experience blockers** because experts knew how to navigate the system.

Flow tests revealed:
- **Entry point problems** (directory listing)
- **Discovery issues** (can't find features)
- **Onboarding friction** (too complex)
- **Missing progressive disclosure** (all or nothing)

### The "Curse of Knowledge"
Developers and experts suffer from the "curse of knowledge" - we know:
- To type /chat.html in the URL
- What API keys are and how to get them
- How to navigate without menus
- What features exist

**First-time users don't have this context.**

### Progressive Disclosure Failure
Current system is "all or nothing":
- Either you setup API keys OR you can't use anything
- Either you know the URLs OR you're lost
- Either you understand tech OR it's too complex

**Fix:** Implement progressive disclosure:
1. Land on homepage (value prop)
2. Try demo mode (no commitment)
3. Sign up if convinced (simple process)
4. Add API keys (when ready)
5. Explore advanced features (gradually)
