# ✅ Railway Deployment Fix Applied

## 🔧 Problem Identified
Railway deployment failed because:
- `tsx` was in `devDependencies`
- Start script uses `node --loader tsx` which requires `tsx` in production
- Railway doesn't install devDependencies in production builds

## ✅ Fix Applied
**Commit:** `5b37b80`
**Change:** Moved `tsx` from `devDependencies` to `dependencies`

```json
"dependencies": {
  ...
  "tsx": "^4.19.2",  // ✅ Now in production dependencies
  ...
}
```

## 🚀 Railway Auto-Deploy Status

Railway is configured for auto-deploy from GitHub:
- ✅ Fix pushed to master branch
- 🔄 Railway should automatically detect change
- 🔄 Rebuilding with tsx in dependencies
- ⏱️ **Estimated time:** 2-5 minutes

## 📊 Check Deployment Status

**In your Railway dashboard:**
1. Go to: https://railway.com/project/48c8bfa4-271d-4280-bc5f-645fb8330f72
2. Click on "Deployments" tab
3. Look for latest deployment with commit message: "Fix Railway deployment..."
4. Status should show: "Building..." → "Deploying..." → "Active"

## ✅ What to Expect

When deployment succeeds:
- ✅ Application starts successfully
- ✅ Logs show: "Server running on port..."
- ✅ Health check endpoint works
- ✅ All API endpoints accessible

## 🧪 Test When Ready

```bash
# Get your Railway URL from Settings → Domains
# Example: https://mcp-universal-bridge-production.up.railway.app

# Test health endpoint
curl https://your-app.up.railway.app/health

# Should return:
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "...",
  "providers": {}
}
```

## 📋 If Still Failing

Check Railway logs for:
1. **Build logs:** npm install should include tsx
2. **Runtime logs:** Look for startup errors
3. **Port binding:** Application should listen on `process.env.PORT`

## 💬 Status

**Current:** Waiting for Railway auto-redeploy (2-5 min)
**Next:** Test production URL and verify all endpoints work

---

## 🎯 Production URL

Once deployed, get your URL from Railway:
1. Railway Dashboard → Settings → Domains
2. Click "Generate Domain" (if not already done)
3. Copy URL (format: `https://xxx.up.railway.app`)
4. Send to me for verification testing!

**Fix is complete - Railway is redeploying now** ✅
