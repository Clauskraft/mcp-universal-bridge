# Extension Icons

Please create three PNG icon files for the Chrome Extension:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

## Icon Design Suggestions

The icons should represent:
- 📝 Caption/subtitle capture
- 🎤 Real-time recording
- 💬 Speech/text conversion

You can use tools like:
- GIMP (free)
- Photoshop
- Online icon generators
- Figma

Or use emoji-to-icon converters with the 📝 emoji.

## Temporary Solution

Until proper icons are created, you can use any PNG files with the correct dimensions.
The extension will still work without custom icons (Chrome will use default icons).
